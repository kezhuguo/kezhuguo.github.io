	abstract= "Constraints on the Wilson coefficients (WCs) corresponding to dimension-six operators of the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) are determined from a simultaneous fit to seven sets of CMS measurements probing Higgs boson, electroweak vector boson, top quark, and multi-jet production. The measurements of the electroweak precision observables at LEP and SLC are also included and provide complementary constraints to those from CMS. The CMS measurements, using 36-138 fb^{−1} of LHC proton-proton collision data at √s= 13 TeV, are chosen to provide sensitivity to a broad set of operators, for which consistent SMEFT predictions can be derived. These are primarily measurements of differential cross sections or, in the case of Higgs boson production, simplified template cross sections, which are subsequently parametrized in the WCs. Measurements targeting t¯tX production model the SMEFT effects directly in the reconstructed observables. Individual constraints on 64 WCs, and constraints on 42 linear combinations of WCs, are obtained. In the case of the linear combinations, the 42 parameters are varied simultaneously."
